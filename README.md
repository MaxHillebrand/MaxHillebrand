I'm contributing to several free software projects, building the tools I want to use in order to defend my liberties.
As these weapons of cyberspace are fundamentally non-scarce, I share my work free for anyone to use.
My focus is on creating a second realm with a sound monetary economy in which sovereign individuals can pursue their entrepreneurial action.
