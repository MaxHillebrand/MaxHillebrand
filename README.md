I'm contributing to several open source projects building the tools I want to use in order to defend my liberties.
As these weapons of cyberspace are fundamentally non-scarce, I share my work free for anyone to use.
My focus is on creating a second realm with a sound monetary economy where sovereign individuals can persue their entrepreneurial action.
